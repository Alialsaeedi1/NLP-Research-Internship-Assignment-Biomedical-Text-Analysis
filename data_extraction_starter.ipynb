      "between cuprotosis and LGG patients' prognosis, we conducted this study in which \n",
      "LGG patients were divided into two clusters based on the expression of 18 \n",
      "cuprotosis-related genes. We found that LGG patients in cluster A had better \n",
      "prognosis than those in cluster B. The two clusters also differed in terms of \n",
      "immune cell infiltration and biological functions. Moreover, we identified \n",
      "differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two clusters and developed a \n",
      "cuprotosis-related prognostic signature through the least absolute shrinkage and \n",
      "selection operator (LASSO) analysis in the TCGA training cohort. This signature \n",
      "divided LGG patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group \n",
      "having significantly shorter overall survival (OS) time than the low-risk group. \n",
      "Its predictive reliability for prognosis in LGG patients was confirmed by the \n",
      "TCGA internal validation cohort, CGGA325 cohort and CGGA693 cohort. \n",
      "Additionally, a nomogram was used to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of \n",
      "each patient. The analysis of immune checkpoints and tumor mutation burden (TMB) \n",
      "has revealed that individuals belonging to high-risk groups have a greater \n",
      "chance of benefiting from immunotherapy. Functional experiments confirmed that \n",
      "interfering with the signature gene TNFRSF11B inhibited LGG cell proliferation \n",

      "4. BACKGROUND: Disulfidptosis, a recently discovered cellular death mechanism, has \n",

      "previous research has integrated disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs), \n",
      "cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs), and ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) to \n",
      "construct a prognostic signature for BC.\n",
      "METHODS: DRGs, CRGs and FRGs with prognostic potential were identified through \n",
      "Cox regression analysis. A predictive model was constructed by intersecting the \n",
      "core genes obtained from unsupervised cluster analysis and weighted correlation \n",
      "network analysis (WGCNA). Differences in chemotherapy drug sensitivity, immune \n",
      "checkpoint levels were analyzed according to different risk score groups. The \n",
      "expression of the core disulfidptosis gene, SLC7A11, was analyzed using \n",
      "immunofluorescence.\n",
      "RESULTS: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed differential expression of \n",
      "DRGs in the BC tumor microenvironment. We developed a prognostic model, \n",
      "consisting of six genes, based on machine learning which included unsupervised \n",
      "cluster analysis and Lasso-Cox analysis. An internal training set and a \n",
      "validation set, both derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Breast Cancer \n",
      "(TCGA-BRCA) database, GSE20685 and GSE42568 as external validation sets all \n",
      "verified the model's validity. The low-risk group exhibited increased \n",
      "sensitivity to paclitaxel. Additionally, the high-risk group demonstrated \n",
      "significantly higher expression of tumor mutation burden and microsatellite \n",
      "instability compared to the low-risk group. A nomogram confirmed that the risk \n",
      "score can be an independent risk factor for BC. Notably, our findings \n",
      "highlighted the impact of SLC7A11 on the BC tumor microenvironment. \n",
      "Immunofluorescence analysis revealed significantly higher expression of SLC7A11 \n",
      "in BC tissues compared to paracancerous tissues.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Multiplex analysis based on DRGs, CRGs and FRGs correlated strongly \n",
