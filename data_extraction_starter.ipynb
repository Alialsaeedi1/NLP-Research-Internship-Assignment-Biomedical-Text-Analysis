      "to anti-inflammatory adenosine (ADO). A broad variety of solid cancer types was \n",
      "shown to exploit CD73 overexpression as a suppressive immune checkpoint. \n",
      "Consequently, CD73-antagonistic antibodies, most notably oleclumab, are \n",
      "currently evaluated in several multicenter trials for clinical applicability. \n",
      "However, the efficacy of conventional monospecific CD73-inhibiting antibodies \n",
      "may be limited due to on-target/off-tumor binding to CD73 on normal cells. \n",
      "Therefore, a novel approach that more selectively directs CD73 immune checkpoint \n",
      "inhibition towards cancer cells is warranted.\n",
      "METHODS: To address this issue, we constructed a novel tetravalent bispecific \n",
      "antibody (bsAb), designated bsAb CD73xEGFR. Subsequently, the anticancer \n",
      "activities of bsAb CD73xEGFR were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo tumor \n",
      "models.\n",
      "RESULTS: In vitro treatment of various carcinoma cell types with bsAb CD73xEGFR \n",
      "potently inhibited the enzyme activity of CD73 (~71%) in an EGFR-directed \n",
      "manner. In this process, bsAb CD73xEGFR induced rapid internalization of \n",
      "antigen/antibody complexes, which resulted in a prolonged concurrent \n",
      "displacement of both CD73 and EGFR from the cancer cell surface. In addition, \n",
      "bsAb CD73xEGFR sensitized cancer to the cytotoxic activity of various \n",
      "chemotherapeutic agents and potently inhibited the proliferative/migratory \n",
      "capacity (~40%) of cancer cells. Unexpectedly, we uncovered that treatment of \n",
      "carcinoma cells with oleclumab appeared to enhance several pro-oncogenic \n",
      "features, including upregulation and phosphorylation of EGFR, tumor cell \n",
      "proliferation (~20%), and resistance towards cytotoxic agents and ionizing \n",
      "radiation (~39%). Importantly, in a tumor model using immunocompetent BALB/c \n",
      "mice inoculated with syngeneic CD73pos/EGFRpos CT26 cancer cells, treatment with \n",
      "bsAb CD73xEGFR outperformed oleclumab (65% vs 31% tumor volume reduction). \n",
      "Compared with oleclumab, treatment with bsAb CD73xEGFR enhanced the intratumoral \n",
      "presence of CD8pos T cells and M1 macrophages.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: BsAb CD73xEGFR outperforms oleclumab as it inhibits the CD73/ADO \n",

      "several oncogenic activities of EGFR and CD73. Therefore, bsAb CD73xEGFR may be \n",

      "shown to exploit CD73 overexpression as a suppressive immune checkpoint. \n",
      "Consequently, CD73-antagonistic antibodies, most notably oleclumab, are \n",
      "currently evaluated in several multicenter trials for clinical applicability. \n",
      "However, the efficacy of conventional monospecific CD73-inhibiting antibodies \n",
      "may be limited due to on-target/off-tumor binding to CD73 on normal cells. \n",
      "Therefore, a novel approach that more selectively directs CD73 immune checkpoint \n",
      "inhibition towards cancer cells is warranted.\n",
      "METHODS: To address this issue, we constructed a novel tetravalent bispecific \n",
      "antibody (bsAb), designated bsAb CD73xEGFR. Subsequently, the anticancer \n",

      "RESULTS: In vitro treatment of various carcinoma cell types with bsAb CD73xEGFR \n",
      "potently inhibited the enzyme activity of CD73 (~71%) in an EGFR-directed \n",

      "4. INTRODUCTION: LUAD (Lung adenocarcinoma), the most common subtype of lung \n",
      "carcinoma and one of the highest incidences and mortality cancers in the world \n",
      "remains still a substantial treatment challenge. Ivermectin, an avermectin \n",
      "derivative, has been traditionally used as an antiparasitic agent in human and \n",
      "veterinary medicine practice during the last few decades. Though ivermectin has \n",
      "been shown to be effective against a variety of cancers, however, there is few \n",
      "available data reporting the antitumor effects of ivermectin in LUAD.\n",
      "METHODS: The effect of ivermectin on cell viability and proliferative ability of \n",
      "LUAD cells was evaluated using CCK-8 and colony formation assay. Apoptosis rate \n",
      "and autophagy flux were detected using flow cytometry based on PI/Annexin V \n",
      "staining and confocal laser scanning microscope based on LC3-GFP/RFP puncta, \n",
      "respectively. Western blotting experiment was conducted to verify the results of \n",
      "changes in apoptosis and autophagy. LUAD-TCGA and GEO databases were used to \n",
      "analyse the expression and predictive value of PAK1 in LUAD patients. Xenograft \n",
      "model and immumohistochemical staining were used for verification of the \n",
      "inhibitor effect of ivermectin in vivo.\n",
      "RESULTS: Ivermectin treatment strikingly impeded the colony formation, and the \n",
      "viability of the cell, along with cell proliferation, and caused the apoptosis \n",
      "and enhanced autophagy flux in LUAD cells. In addition, ivermectin-induced \n",
      "nonprotective autophagy was confirmed by treating LUAD cells with 3-MA, an \n",
      "autophagy inhibitor. Mechanistically, we found that ivermectin inhibited PAK1 \n",
      "protein expression in LUAD cells and we confirmed that overexpression of PAK1 \n",
      "substantially inhibited ivermectin-induced autophagy in LUAD cells. Based on \n",
      "TCGA and GEO databases, PAK1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues as compared \n",
      "with normal tissues. Furthermore, LUAD patients with high PAK1 level have poor \n",
      "overall survival. Finally, in vivo experiments revealed that ivermectin \n",
      "efficiently suppressed the cellular growth of LUAD among nude mice.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: This study not only revealed the mechanism of ivermectin inhibited \n",
      "the growth of LUAD but also supported an important theoretical basis for the \n",
      "development of ivermectin during the therapy for LUAD.\n",

      "5. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a morphologically heterogeneous disease with five \n",
      "predominant histologic subtypes. Fully supervised convolutional neural networks \n",
      "can improve the accuracy and reduce the subjectivity of LUAD histologic \n",
      "subtyping using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs). \n",
      "However, developing supervised models with good prediction accuracy usually \n",
      "requires extensive manual data annotation, which is time-consuming and \n",
      "labor-intensive. This work proposes three self-supervised learning (SSL) pretext \n",
      "tasks to reduce labeling effort. These tasks not only leverage the \n",
      "multi-resolution nature of the H&E WSIs but also explicitly consider the \n",
      "relevance to the downstream task of classifying the LUAD histologic subtypes. \n",
      "Two tasks involve predicting the spatial relationship between tiles cropped from \n",
      "lower and higher magnification WSIs. We hypothesize that these tasks induce the \n",
      "model to learn to distinguish different tissue structures presented in the \n",
      "images, thus benefiting the downstream classification. The third task involves \n",
      "predicting the eosin stain from the hematoxylin stain, inducing the model to \n",
      "learn cytoplasmic features relevant to LUAD subtypes. The effectiveness of the \n",
      "three proposed SSL tasks and their ensemble was demonstrated by comparison with \n",
      "other state-of-the-art pretraining and SSL methods using three publicly \n",
      "available datasets. Our work can be extended to any other cancer type where \n",

    "##### Q1. Could you please articulate your understanding of NLP as a technology, including any hands-on experience you may have in this specific field?\n",
    "Throughout history, humans used text all the time, and the history of humanity is fully dependent on preserving texts. NLP uses this text to generate insightful results that would assist us in our daily lives. We already saw ChatGPT and the revolution it created when GPT was trained on a very small subset of texts available, which showed us the incredible results that NLP could acheive. After ChatGPT, the interest increased in the NLP field which will help in more research and hopefully better tools that will yield better results. My experience in NLP started 2 years ago when I took a course in unviersity that made it my favourite course. I also chose it for one of my project where I created a model trained on about 300 Doctoral thesis that helps finding the most similar abstract to a query of the user's choice. I also took a course in Information Retreival and Text mining where I had to make something useful with a book my choice. What I did was using a website for summaries to scrape the summaries and apply different methods such as Entity Recogntions, Topic Modelling, Emotion Analysis, and evaluations of the methods. I will also take an elective in Advanced Natural Language Processing next period which will help me increase my knowledge in new methods such as transformers.\n",
    "##### Q2. We'd love to hear your thoughts on how NLP techniques could be employed to extract pertinent biomedical information from academic publications or alternative data sources.\n",
    "The first appraoch that I get in mind is training models on academic publications and creating a retreival system that takes into account context rather than keywords. As humans, we always use synonyms which are not taken into account in most retreival systems, which makes me confident that biomedical information extraction would be easier with such system. Another Idea in mind is to pre-train existing models such as GPT-3 on academic publications to create a QA system which would be more powerful than a retreival system. I haven't researched the efficiency of such approach but I'm sure it's feasible.\n",
    "##### Q3. Are there particular NLP algorithms or methodologies that you believe would be exceptionally beneficial in the biomedical research context?\n",
    "BERT is one of the methods that I believe can make difference in any field that uses NLP. Personally, I would like to try Sentence-BERT on a similar appraoch to the one I implemented to find similar documents. According to my research, I felt there's a big room for improvment in the field of NLP and Biomedical research and I felt the potential for using NLP in the field. "
